# Scaffold-ETH Noir

Sandbox project for testing age-restricted contracts using [Noir](https://noir-lang.org/0.6.0/) for writing ZKP-circuits. Also has *basic* dynamic UI for expirimenting with circuits and proof-generation. This was built using Scaffold-ETH 2, [refer to SE2 README for set-up](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-2#readme).

* requires [nargo](https://noir-lang.org/0.6.0/getting_started/nargo_installation) (tested with v0.6.0)

### TODO
* improve UI
* proof generation in browser ([depends on bb.js](https://github.com/AztecProtocol/barretenberg/issues/517)).
* possibly turn in to an challange like [SpeedrunEthereum](https://speedrunethereum.com/)
